            <p>
                Xiaohui Qi is a clinician and a master's student in Medicine at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
                <br />Over the
                past eight years, she has received rigorous training in both clinical medicine and scientific research
                and is capable to work in both dry labs (data mining and statistical analysis using R and Python) and
                wet labs (animal experiments). <br />During her master's degree, she focused on metabolic risk factors
                for
                hepatobiliary cancer and published her findings in peer-reviewed journals as a first or corresponding
                author. She is currently seeking a Ph.D. position in cancer research in a wet lab or mixed wet/dry lab.

            <h4>1. The effect of type 2 diabetes and obesity on biliary tract cancer with cholesterol and total
                bilirubin adjusted</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Responsibility: principal study designer and independent researcher, thesis selection, research
                    framework development, code building, statistical analysis and data visualization, manuscript
                    writing
                    and preparing for publication, reply to review comments</li>
                <li>Method: multivariable Mendelian randomization analysis</li>
                <li>
                    Significance: This study clarifies that it does not type 2 diabetes and obesity but low-density
                    lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) that causes biliary tract cancer. As LDL-C levels can be lowered by
                    lifestyle interventions and drug therapy, this study provides a new perspective on the prevention of
                    biliary tract cancer in obese and diabetic populations with dyslipidemia.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>2. The association between insulin therapy and the risk of biliary tract cancer</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Responsibility: leading study designer and researcher, thesis selection, research framework
                    development, code building, statistical analysis and data visualization, manuscript writing and
                    preparing for publication, reply to review comments</li>
                <li>
                    Method: Cox proportional hazards regression model
                </li>
                <li>
                    Significance: This study reveals that only the risk of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECC)
                    increased in insulin users, suggesting that the relationship between insulin therapy and the risk of
                    biliary tract cancer is type-specific. More attention should be paid to diabetic patients with ECC
                    risk
                    factors.
                </li>

            <h4>
                Literature review about the role of insulin and incretin-based drugs in biliary tract cancer
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Responsibility: project leader and correspondence author, thesis selection, conceptualization,
                    literature search, manuscript writing and preparing for publication, reply to review comments
                </li>
                <li>
                    Significance: This review shows that the complex effects of insulin and incretin-based drugs as well
                    as the heterogeneity of biliary tract cancer prevent a consistent conclusion among the observational
                    studies. We suggest that both epidemiological and experimental studies should classify these drugs
                    and biliary tract cancer specifically into different subtypes during the future investigation.

            <h4>1. The causal relationship between morning plasma cortisol levels and obesity</h4>

                <li>Method: bi-directional Mendelian randomization analysis</li>
                <li>
                    Significance: This study shows that blunted morning plasma cortisol secretion is responsible for
                    severe obesity. Restoring the normal morning cortisol secretion is important in maintaining healthy
                    body weight.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Significance: This study shows that exposure to ambient PM2.5 has an acute effect on the elevation
                    of circulating lipid levels. People in areas with high PM2.5 pollution should pay attention to daily
                    protection to reduce the risk of dyslipidemia and cardiovascular diseases
